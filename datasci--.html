    <p>A groundbreaking study in 2013 reported 90% of the entirety of the world’s data has been created within the previous two years. Let that sink in. In just two years, we've collected and processed 9x the amount of information than the previous 92,000 years of humankind combined. And it isn’t slowing down. It’s projected we’ve already created 2.7 zettabytes of data, and by 2020, that number will balloon to an astounding 44 zettabytes.

What do we do with all of this data? How do we make it useful to us? What are it's real-world applications? These questions are the domain of data science.

Every company will say they’re doing a form of data science, but what exactly does that mean? The field is growing so rapidly, and revolutionizing so many industries, it's difficult to fence in its capabilities with a formal definition, but generally data science is devoted to the extraction of clean information from raw data for the formulation of actionable insights.
Commonly referred to as the “oil of the 21st century," our digital data carries the most importance in the field. It has incalculable benefits in business, research and our everyday lives. Your route to work, your most recent Google search for the nearest coffee shop, your Instagram post about what you ate, and even the health data from your fitness tracker are all important to different data scientists in different ways. Sifting through massive lakes of data, looking for connections and patterns, data science is responsible for bringing us new products, delivering breakthrough insights and making our lives more convenient.  </p>

<div class="para">


  <p>Data science involves a plethora of disciplines and expertise areas to produce a holistic, thorough and refined look into raw data. Data scientists must be skilled in everything from data engineering, math, statistics, advanced computing and visualizations to be able to effectively sift through muddled masses of information and communicate only the most vital bits that will help drive innovation and efficiency.

Data scientists also rely heavily on artificial intelligence, especially its subfields of machine learning and deep learning, to create models and make predictions using algorithms and other techniques.

Data science generally has a five-stage life cycle that consists of1:

Capture: Data acquisition, data entry, signal reception, data extraction
Maintain: Data warehousing, data cleansing, data staging, data processing, data architecture
Process: Data mining, clustering/classification, data modeling, data summarization
Communicate: Data reporting, data visualization, business intelligence, decision making
Analyze: Exploratory/confirmatory, predictive analysis, regression, text mining, qualitative analysis </p>
